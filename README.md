# JTicTacToe
Assignment for Java course. This application can work as an TCP server which can handle multiple TicTacToe games simultaneously, or as an TCP client which can be used to play a TicTacToe game over a network.

# Future Goals
- Improve documentation (especially for the client-server communication protocol);
- Improve performance/ optimize existing code;
- Add "game preview" feature in the server GUI;
- More (new ideas are well accepted ðŸ˜‰).
